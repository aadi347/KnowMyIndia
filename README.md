Project Overview

This repository contains an interactive India map project built using D3.js and GeoJSON. The map renders all Indian states using polygon data defined by latitude and longitude coordinates, enabling precise control and smooth interactions.

Users can hover, zoom, or select a state, and the map dynamically updates to display information like population, languages, capital city, and popular tourist places. A random state tour feature highlights a randomly selected state for an interactive exploration experience.

The project is built with React.js, styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered by Node.js for supporting logic.
